  The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every
year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry,
literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel
Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and
male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way. Surely, right?
